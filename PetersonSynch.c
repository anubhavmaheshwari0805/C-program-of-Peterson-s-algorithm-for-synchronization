/*Problem:The producer consumer problem (or bounded buffer problem) describes two processes,
the producer and the consumer, which share a common, fixed-size buffer used as a queue.
Producer produce an item and put it into buffer.
If buffer is already full then producer will have to wait for an empty block in buffer.
Consumer consume an item from buffer.
If buffer is already empty then consumer will have to wait for an item in buffer.
Implement Petersonï¿½s Algorithm for the two processes using shared memory such that there is mutual exclusion between them.
The solution should have free from synchronization problems.*/
